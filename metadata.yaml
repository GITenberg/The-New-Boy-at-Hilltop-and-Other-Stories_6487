description: Hilltop School closed its fall term with just ninety-five students; it
  opened again two weeks later, on the third of January, with ninety-six; and thereby
  hangs this tale. Kenneth Garwood had been booked for Hilltop in the autumn, but
  circumstances had interfered with the family's plans. Instead he journeyed to Moritzville
  on the afternoon of the day preceding the commencement of the new term, a very cold
  and blustery January afternoon.
